# Movie Business Analysis: Exploring Correlations

The goal of this Python project is to investigate and analyze correlations between different variablesÂ of the movie industry. Movie ratings, genres, release years, scores, votes, writers, directors, actors, budgets, nations, gross earnings, production firms, and runtime are all included in the dataset that was used.

## Methodology
For data analysis, we used the Python programming language and well-known tools like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.  
**Data Cleaning**: To guarantee accuracy and consistency, the dataset was subjected to stringent cleaning procedures. It involved, filling missing values, changing data types  and sorting data.  
**Correlation Analysis**: Correlation Analysis: To measure the connections between the variables, correlation matrices were created.  
**Regression Analysis**: In order to determine the link between variables, regression models were used, with a special emphasis on projecting earnings in light of other variables.  
**Visualization**: To show trends, patterns, and correlations in the data, a number of charts and visualizations were made.  

## Findings
**Gross Earnings vs. Budget**: The two variables for a film have a substantial correlation. This implies that productions with larger budgets might typically result in better profits.  
**Gross Earnings vs. Votes**: A significant relationship was found between a film's gross revenue and the quantity of votes it obtained. This suggests that the revenue from popular films is typically higher.  

## Conclusion
The results of this analysis offer insightful information about the film industry, especially when it comes to the variables that affect a film's box office receipts. Stakeholders can make better decisions about marketing tactics and money allocation by being aware of these linkages.
